            <h1>The Princess of Wales Does Wedding-Guest Dressing in a Blush-Pink Archive Gown</h1>
            <p>The Princess of Wales made a rare appearance as a wedding guest in Amman, Jordan, as Crown Prince Hussein and Rajwa Al Saif tied the knot at Zahran Palace. For the occasion, Kate wore a blush-pink high-neck gown by Elie Saab, featuring delicate floral embroidery on the bodice, which she paired with statement earrings and a gold clutch. Typically, the royal turns to her go-to British house, Alexander McQueen, for formal wedding dressing, making the choice of Lebanese designer Elie Saab 
                particularly significantâ€”and the gown marks one of the most glamorous wedding guest looks we've seen to date from Kate</p>
